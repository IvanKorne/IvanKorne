Hi, I'm Ivan Korneychuk.

I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I approach it with enthusiasm and a growth mindset. I love working in teams and am open to any challenge.

Since I was a young child, I have always been interested in and fascinated by computers. My experience building computers has led me to the realization that this is what I want to focus my life on. 
I decided to take on a new challenge this past year and learn how to code. Although the journey was difficult, I am now confident in my abilities in C++, learning sorting algortithms, 
pointers and references, and how to utilize classes for Object-Oriented Programming.

Currently, I am studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I am exposed to incredible learning opportunites and the best teaching in Canada.

I would love to be able to utilize my skills, but what is most important to me is being exposed to an environment where I can learn essential skills for my future goals.

You can reach me at ikorneyc@uwaterloo.ca or my phone number (226) 280-7168.
