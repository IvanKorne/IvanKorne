Hi, I'm Ivan Korneychuk.

I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I approach it with enthusiasm and a growth mindset. I love working in teams and am open to any challenge.

Currently, I am studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I am exposed to incredible learning opportunites and the best teaching in Canada.

I would love to be able to utilize my skills, but what is most important to me is being exposed to an environment where I can learn essential skills for my future goals.

You can reach me at ikorneyc@uwaterloo.ca or 226-260-5849.
